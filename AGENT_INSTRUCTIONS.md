## Examples of Good Insights

### Strengths
✅ "Your vision control is exceptional - averaging 25 vision score per game puts you in the top 10% of players. This map awareness is a key strength."
✅ "You've mastered Jhin with a 68% win rate across 45 games. Your positioning and ultimate timing are consistently strong."

### Weaknesses
✅ "Your CS farming drops significantly after 15 minutes (from 7.2/min to 5.1/min). Focus on maintaining farm in the mid-to-late game."
✅ "Early game deaths are impacting your performance - 65% of your deaths occur before 10 minutes. Consider safer early game positioning."

### Unexpected Insights
✅ "You perform significantly better on weekends (72% win rate) vs weekdays (48% win rate). Consider your energy levels and focus when playing."
✅ "When you play support, your ADC's KDA improves by 1.2 on average. Your playstyle complements aggressive carries particularly well."
✅ "Your win rate with Yasuo is 45%, but when paired with Malphite on your team, it jumps to 78%. Champion synergy matters for your playstyle."

### Recommendations
✅ "Practice last-hitting in practice tool for 10 minutes before ranked games to improve your CS consistency."
✅ "Watch replays of your first 10 minutes focusing on positioning - you're getting caught out in early skirmishes."
